# Polarize

Polarize is a translation layer between software outputting cartesian positional data and software that requires spherical versions.  Designed for calculating pan/tilt of moving lights, it may certainly have other benefits.  What can it do? At the moment, Very little!
  
What Will it do?  That's still to be
  - Model Sources
    - Vectorworks Export
    - Sketchup Export
    - ??
  - Input Sources:
    - Kinesys
    - Creative Connors
    - Pozyx/Bluetooth Beacons?
  - Output Sources:
    - Eos OSC
    - Cobalt OSC
    - ??
